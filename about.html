                <h3>Meet Our Founder: Kalin's Story</h3>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>At 27, I made one of the biggest bets possible: leaving traditional employment to build an entrepreneurial empire from my motherâ€™s house. This isn't a setbackâ€”it's a strategic move that minimizes overhead and maximizes capital for my family's future. I'm fighting to prove that sacrifice, creativity, and relentless work can transform not just my family's future, but create positive change in gaming, education, and communities worldwide.</p>

                    <h4>A Lifelong Passion for Technology</h4>
                    <p>I was introduced to computers at a pretty early age, partially due to the dot-com boom and a little bit because my grandmother was a teacher for most of her life, so she kinda instilled that early sense of curiosity and desire to learn in me. She's actually the one that helped me make my first email address when I was about eight or nine.</p>

                    <p>What got me so passionate about it is just from so early on in my life, I've been a part of the "Digital Age." I've been so immersed in technology and various communities that they really shaped some of my core beliefs today. Now don't get me wrong, I've been in places online as a kid I had no business being, but it was those experiences as well that sparked the drive in me to make the internet a safer space for kids to explore and express themselves without being exposed to things they have no business being exposed to.</p>

                    <p>I say all this to say I'm passionate about technology and my community because I can see the good in those things when people who actually want to do good things are able to. I've just always dreamed of being that person doing good things for others and aspiring to be a beacon of light for people who feel like they don't know what to do or don't have anyone to help them get to where they want to go in life.</p>
