                        Began exploring technology seriously while working traditional jobs. Started understanding that my real passion was in creating digital experiences that bring people together rather than drive them apart. Began initial research into game development and educational technology.

                        Intensive self-study in programming fundamentals (Python, JavaScript), cybersecurity principles, and game development concepts.
