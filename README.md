## 🚀 Image Setup

The `/images` folder contains branded **placeholder images**.  
They are designed to give the site a professional and visually appealing look until custom assets are ready.

### Current Images
- `logo.png` → Company logo (square, transparent PNG)
- `hero-bg.jpg` → Hero landing section background
- `services.jpg` → Services section illustration
- `community.jpg` → Community page background
- `contact.jpg` → Contact page background

### Recommended Resolutions
- `logo.png` → 1024 × 1024 px (1:1)
- `hero-bg.jpg` → 1920 × 1080 px (16:9)
- `services.jpg` → 1200 × 800 px (3:2)
- `community.jpg` → 1920 × 1080 px (16:9)
- `contact.jpg` → 1920 × 1080 px (16:9)

### Regenerating Images
If you want to recreate or update these placeholders using an AI image generator:
1. Use the prompts included in the **Image Prompts Guide** (see `/docs` if added later).
2. Match the **aspect ratio (`--ar`)** values listed above.
3. Save with the same file names into `/images` to keep the site linked properly.

### Swapping in Final Assets
When ready to replace placeholders with official branding:
- Keep file names the same (e.g., replace `logo.png` with the final logo file).  
- Or, update the `<img src="...">` references in the HTML files if new names are preferred.

## 🛠️ Development Notes
- Ensure optimized file sizes (under 1 MB per image for performance).  
- Use `.jpg` for large backgrounds, `.png` for logos/icons.
