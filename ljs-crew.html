                <h3>Honoring a Legacy of Service</h3>
                <p>LJ's Crew is our community outreach program created in loving memory of my grandfather, Larry Joe Smith, who taught me the importance of helping others and building stronger communities. Through this program, we carry forward his spirit of service and compassion.</p>

                <h4>The Man Behind the Mission</h4>
                <p>To us, he was LJ, or sometimes "Larry Joe," and he loved us so much. He was a father, a grandfather, a husband, and a friend to many. But to me, he was who I wanted to be when I grew up. The inspiration for this program came from my mom, who one day talked about how she wanted to do something to honor his name. Since I had already been thinking about starting a community outreach program, it only made sense to put the two together, as I know he would have loved to be a part of something like this.</p>
